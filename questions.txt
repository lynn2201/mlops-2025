1. Why do we use a BasePreprocessor class?
To define a common structure for preprocessors and ensure each one has a process() method.

2. Why move preprocessing code into a class?
To avoid repeating code, make the logic reusable, and allow switching preprocessors easily.

3. Why do we create a BaseFeaturesComputer class?
To standardize feature engineering and ensure all feature classes follow the same interface.

4. Why move feature engineering into a class?
To keep code modular, easier to understand, and allow different feature strategies.

5. Why use a BaseModel class?
To unify the train() and predict() interface so we can swap models without changing scripts.

6. What improvements could still be made to the package?
Add tests, logging, error handling, configs, and better documentation.

7. What differences did you observe between models?
Logistic Regression is simple but may underfit. RandomForest handles non-linear patterns better. XGBoost performs best but needs tuning.
